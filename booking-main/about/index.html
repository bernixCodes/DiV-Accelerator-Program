      <h3>BUSINESS CLASS CARS. AT YOUR SERVICE</h3>
      <div class="detail">
        <p>From humble beginnings to London’s most trusted business-class car service in just over forty years, Addison Lee have grown with and for the times.</p>
        <p>And yet, so little has changed about us. We still believe that minicabs can be so much more than just a means to an end – our clients are right to expect extraordinary standards, and by allying the latest technologies with traditional customer service values, we can not only disrupt the industry,can revolutionise it.</p>
        <p>Today, our iconic cars are responsible for getting over 10 million people where they need to go each year in London alone. And with our business expanding every day – across both the UK and worldwide – we will continue to deliver that same executive service consistently, no matter where we are.</p>
